# RailwayPlatformTicketGenerator
• Developed a Python script on Google Colab to address the challenge of manual platform ticket issuance at railway
stations.
• The script generates platform tickets with QR codes, streamlining the process and reducing queues at railway counters.
• Utilized the qrcode library to encode ticket details and produce QR codes for efficient verification.
• Implemented functions to create unique ticket IDs, capture user information, and set expiration times.
• Future plans include integrating with WhatsApp or SMS for enhanced notification capabilities.
